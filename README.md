# eUPF

eUPF is the opensource User Plane Function (UPF) project for using inside or "outside" of any 3GPP 5G core. The goal of the project is to provide high-observability and easily-deployed software for a various cases like multi-access edge computing (MEC) and local traffic breakout. eUPF is built with eBPF to provide high observability and performance. 

 eUPF is tested with Free5GC and Open5GS 5G cores. 

## What is 5G core and CUPS

5G core uses network virtualized functions (NVF) to provide connectivity and services. 
Control and user plane separation (CUPS) is important architecture enhancement that separates control plane and user plane insde 5G core. 
User plane function (UPF) is the "decapsulating and routing" function that extracts user plane traffic from GPRS tunneling protocol (GTP) and route it to the public data network or local network via the best available path.

## Metrics

### PFCP message metrics
This set of metrics describes how many requests of each type has been processed with outcome specified.
All metrics except for `upf_pfcp_rx_latency` are counters and labeled with `result` indicating if message was successfuly processed or rejected.
**Note:** `upf_pfcp_rx` and `upf_pfcp_rx_errors` have different implementation and counted at different points, we will drop one or another after evaluation, or implement a different counters altogether.
| Metric Name         | Description                                                |

| upf_pfcp_tx         | The total number of transmitted PFCP messages              |
| upf_pfcp_rx_errors  | The total number of received PFCP messages with cause code |
| upf_pfcp_rx_latency | The total number of PFCP messages processing duration      |

### XDP Action metrics
This set of metrics are used to count the number of packets with different outcomes, such as the total number of aborted, dropped, passed, transmitted, and redirected packets.

| upf_xdp_tx       | The total number of transmitted packets |
| upf_xdp_redirect | The total number of redirected packets  |

### Packet metrics
Various packet counters with `packet_type` label.
